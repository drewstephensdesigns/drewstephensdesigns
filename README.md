### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
### This is Drew Stephens!
Welcome to my Github page! I'm Drew and I'm currently finishing my Occupational Safety &amp; Health Master's degree at Columbia Southern University.  I'm also an Active Duty member of the U.S Air Force where I proudly serve as an Aircraft Maintainer. Texas is my home, but the military ha s taken me all over the world.

#### ðŸŒ± Things I'm Working on: 
- Finish my Master's degree
- Learn Kotlin Compose and Multiplatform
- Incorporating Google Gemini into some of my apps

#### ðŸš€ Current Projects:
- **[AFI Explorer:](https://github.com/drewstephensdesigns/AFIExplorer)** *Modernized approach to current U.S Air Force E-Publishing website. Allows U.S Air Force and Space Force members to quickly reference and search the contents of Air Force publications right on their mobile device. All publications sync directly with [e-publishing.af.mil](https://www.e-publishing.af.mil), so you never have to worry if you have the latest guidance or publication.*

- **[API for AFI Explorer:](https://github.com/drewstephensdesigns/AFIExplorer-Android-API)** *This is the AFI Explorer API, a serverless API built using Cloudflare Workers. It periodically fetches and caches data from the U.S. Air Force e-Publishing website and serves it through various endpoints.*

- **[AMXS Family Zone:](https://github.com/drewstephensdesigns/AMXSFamilyZone)** *Multiplatform social networking application designed specifically for the spouses and families of the 317th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron at Dyess AFB, Texas.*
